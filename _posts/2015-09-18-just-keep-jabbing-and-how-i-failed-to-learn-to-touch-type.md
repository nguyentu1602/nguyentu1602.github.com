So I thought I would never learn to touch-type. Boys I was wrong. It's pretty easy to make an excuse along the line of "err I were never taught that in highschool!" or even worse "my chicken pecking typing is just fine!". Now, after two weeks of pain trying to fix my finger muscle memory, I feel awesome! My wpm varies, but atleast I can type along if I speak slowly now, and freedom feels gooooood.


Honestly I didn't understand how I get through college without learning to touch-type. I even wrote a lot of codes for about 5 classes and 2 researchs projects, all chicken pecking style. With flying colors. Those are the hours of neck pain and miserably looking at the key board that I never get back. Heck, I even expose my precious life to the mercy/homicidal thoughts of touch-typists who happened to worked/paired with me. I don't know how they manage to look at me and the keyboard and sleep at night.


It's been fun to learn to touch-type; [and surely I need it too.][typist_link] Maybe shame holds me back; I was kinda ashame that I don't know how to type and don't even want to admit it to myself. Everyone around me is so polite, they never say a word around that and let me succumb to my little fear, pretending that everything was ok. Maybe I'm now more "shameless" :D. Don't know. But this whole pain and joy of the typing episode really makes me think it's time for me to look back to my life, and pick out whatever similar to touch-type, then admit the shame and start to turn it around. Because [admiting that you sucks does have a sick satisfactory, empowering feeling to it.][sucking_link]

Then I realize blogging is just like touch-typing. And there you have it world: another friggin blogger.

Happy Friday.
